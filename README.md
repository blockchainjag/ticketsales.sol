A smart contract for selling tickets

This smart contract allowed the creator to sell tickets. Ethereum provides us with complete transparency and immutability so there is no way that the creator can create more tickets or somehow erase any tickets once the contract (or Dapp) has been deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
The smart contract was programmed as follows: 
o	We issued a certain amount of tickets
o	We assigned a price per ticket
o	We indicated who the buyer of the ticket is
o	We built some conditions to check if the buyer paid enough for the amount of requested tickets
o	We issued the tickets
o	We built logic into the contract to stop the sale once all tickets were sold
